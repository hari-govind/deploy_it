# deploy_it 
Simple to use deployer for Python applications

## Introduction
I am not going to repeat what is said in the one liner above. Suffice to say,
deploy_it makes it easy for you to deploy a python application even it has
truckload of 3rd party dependencies. deploy_it leverages on the awesome power
of virtualenv to do the same, but in a totally painless manner. It can also
setup a systemd service, if required.
